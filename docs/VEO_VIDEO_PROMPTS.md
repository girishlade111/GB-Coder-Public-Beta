## 📝 General Tips for Veo 3.1

1.  **Consistency**: Always mention "Dark mode code editor interface with HTML/CSS/JS panels and white preview" to keep the look consistent between clips.
2.  **Pacing**: If a clip feels too fast, generate it again with the keyword "Slow, smooth mouse movement".
3.  **No Hallucinations**: If Veo adds weird floating text, add negative prompts: "no text overlays, no watermarks, no floating 3d objects".
4.  **Stitching**: Use a video editor (CapCut, Premiere) to stitch these 7s clips together. Add simple cross-dissolve transitions.
